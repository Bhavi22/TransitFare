# Transit Fare System

This is a simple application that is used to compute the transit fare for a passenger from one stop to another based on their tap on and tap off using their credit cards.
The application uses a (sample provided) taps.csv file that contains multiple tap on/off records for different passengers across multiple cards. It then processes the taps.csv file to generate all the trips based off of the taps -
- Tap on and off found for different stops on the same credit card - Completed Trip
- Tap on and off found for the same stop on the same credit card - Cancelled Trip
- Tap on found but no valid tap off recorded against the same credit card - Incomplete Trip

Trips.csv is generated by the application and it contains the costs calculated for each trip based on the type of trip and different costs associated to the stops at which they were recorded.

# Details

The project is built using Maven and the external libraries used for this application are opencsv and JUnit.
The application assumes that the input file is named "taps.csv" and is present in the src/resources folder , and for the purposes of this application this file has been provided with sample data in it to run the application effectively.
The resulting output file - "trips.csv" is written into the project folder.
